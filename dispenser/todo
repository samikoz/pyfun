Frontend:
1. Express app with endpoints: '/', 'validate' and 'dispensed'
2. / will have a form with the following untestable JS functions:
a) requestValidation which sends amount to validate endpt
b) handleValidationResponse
c) reddenForm which will make input field go red and fade away
d) navigateToDispensedPage
3. validate will probably be based on express-validator https://express-validator.github.io/docs/
4. dispensed will be a simple page with the possibility to go back

Immediate:
Docker base image with node, install express, express-validator
Make hello-world page and launch docker to test
Then simply serve the index as we have now - commit at that point


first do locally - then we gonna use the ready package.json file:
mkdir frontend
cd frontend
npm init
npm install express --save
npm install express-validator --save


FROM node:8-jessie
