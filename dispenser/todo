Frontend:
1. Express app with endpoints: '/', 'validate' and 'dispensed'
2. / will have a form with the following untestable JS functions:
a) requestValidation which sends amount to validate endpt
b) handleValidationResponse
c) reddenForm which will make input field go red and fade away
d) navigateToDispensedPage
3. validate will probably be based on express-validator https://express-validator.github.io/docs/
4. dispensed will be a simple page with the possibility to go back
